# Primary Branch of Repository

This is the main branch of the repository. Please do not use this branch to review code! This branch is out of date and only keeps up with changes from the last assignment.

If the repo was cloned, please checkout the proper branch by running:

```git
git checkout assignment-{XX}
```

Where {XX} is the number of the assignment. If the assignment is a single digit number, the number should be prefixed by 0 (i.e. "04". Full branch name "assignment-04").
