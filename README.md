# Main Branch

This is the main branch of the repository. This branch is not for homework review, and will be consistently behind by one assignment. If you have the repository checked out locally, you can switch to the proper branch by running in the terminal...

```git
git checkout assignment-{XX}
```

...where {XX} is the assignment number. Note this number is always at least two digits, so if the assignment number is "4", then the full command is `git checkout assignment-04`.
